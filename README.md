# Socila-Media-App
# socialmedia app (or) Social Network Simulation

This is a simple social network simulation program written in C++. It allows users to create accounts, make friends, send messages, and create social groups.

## Features

- Add users with details like username, first name, last name, age, and gender.
- Make users friends with each other.
- Send messages between users with timestamps.
- Create social groups.
- Add members to social groups (Note: Group management feature needs to be fully implemented).
- Display all users and friendships.

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the code, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed. Save the code in a file named `social_network.cpp` and run the following command:

```sh
g++ -o social_network social_network.cpp



Future Improvements :
Fully implement group management features, including adding members and managing group messages.
Enhance the user interface for better user experience.
Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
